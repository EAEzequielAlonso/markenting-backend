        // Let's assume the JwtStrategy or a global interceptor adds church context.
        // Or we extract it from the user. 

        // Quick fix: The user entity in JWT might not have churchId directly if not custom.
        // Check JwtStrategy.
        // For MVP, assume req.user['churchId'] if we put it there, or query it.

        // If the strategy puts user in req.user, we might need to find their church.

        // If req.user contains churchId (we added it in login response, but not necessarily in token payload).
        // Let's assume the user is logged in context of a church. 

        // For now, let's grab the church from the user's first membership if available.
        // If req.user is just { userId, email }, we need to query.
        // BUT we are injecting `request` which is `any`. 

        // Let's modify the service to accept userId and find the church, or assume churchID is in query. 
        // Best practice: Header or Token. 
        // Let's take it from a query param for flexibility in Frontend or from User if we updated JwtStrategy.
        // Wait, the Login returned `churchId`. The Frontend has it.
        // So the Frontend *knows* the churchId. It should send it.
        // Ideally as a Header `x-church-id` or Query param. 
        // Let's use Query param `?churchId=...` for simplicity, validated that the user belongs to it.
